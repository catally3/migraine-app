# Migraine App

## Running docker

Make sure you have the docker daemon running i.e. via Docker Desktop

You should then be able to use the following at the root directory:

```
docker-compose up
```

or to run detached:

```
docker-compose up -d 
```

If you want to do a clean reset of the db and other parts, you can do:

```
docker-compose down
```
